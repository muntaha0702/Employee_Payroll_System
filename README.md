Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository showcases a terminal-based Employee Payroll System designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Here, you'll explore how to effectively implement abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and leverage key OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in Java.

## Project Highlights:
The project features an abstract Employee class that forms the base for various employee types, with concrete subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee for salary calculations. It includes a user-friendly terminal interface for efficient interaction and data management. This project illustrates key OOP principles through practical coding examples and offers complete source code along with a step-by-step guide for enhanced understanding. ðŸš€ Whether you're a beginner keen to learn or an experienced developer looking to refine your OOP skills, this project is designed to elevate your Java programming expertise.
